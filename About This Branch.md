About This Branch
-----------------

This branch treats the counter and catcher as consecutive networks. So, it will minimize two parameters - the total needs to be around 21, and the prediction of whether or not the network is counting needs to be around 0. So, using the notes (in the brown notebook), after each round, we will train the network by making it try to get 21 (generate 1 hot labels of what the network should have done after the fact, so that in essence we can cheat and see ahead in the deck), and then treat the counter network as if it builds directly off of the counter network (in essence it does. all we do is send in whether or not the network hit or stay. we also are going to have to take a derivative for the argmax i think, because the network outputs floats between -1 and 1 for each output, and we take the argmax of that and plug it in as the move. so if the network outputs .2, and .8 for hit and stay respectively, the catcher will see 0, and 1 respectively. So we have to do a derivative for this)
