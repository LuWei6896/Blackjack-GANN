# What is this project?
This project aims to use neural networks to catch card counters in casinos. 

# How it works
This project runs a number of poker games, first teaching neural networks how to use the card count to help them win, and then begins to train a separate network to pick out card counters from regular players using typical blackjack strategies. The networks use strategies common to generative adversarial neural networks, where the card counters are made to avoid being caught, while still making money, and the network trying to catch them aims to keep up with their changing strategies
